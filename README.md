Imagine taking a trip where everything is dedicated to making sure that you are relaxed. Beach-Luxx Resort is a website for those looking to get-away and pretend the worries of the world don't exist. We believe that the best way to get-away successfully is in luxury. 
### Client Details
Upon opening the webpage, the client is greeted with a tempting visual of clear blue water and thr resort sitting on a white sandy beach. The home and welcome page provides details of our most popular accomodations to visitors such as: Wifi, free parking, complimentary breakfast, early checkout, late checkout and our best rates for that season. The navigation bar displays features such as: Package, Experience & Gallery. Package presents pictures, price details, room description and check in button. Experience gives clients insight of the many luxuries that they can enjoy from our spas, cafe, shops and beach activities. Gallery gives the client a virtual visit, to get a true representation of what sights they may see on their visit.


### Development Process
The Navigation bar will be holding the home and about page as well as experience, packages and gallery, these will be operating as my components in react js. Experience and packages have extensions, these will be operating as pages in react js. The components will have clickable links their pages. I will be utilizing ***Flexbox*** for all my components as they have displays. Experience & Package will showcase they ***Schemas*** which will both display on the front end the backend.
